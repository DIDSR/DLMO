# Sample size determination

This script conducts a power analysis for sample size determination in our paper. To run the script, simply execute `power_analysis_BDG.R`. To use your own pilot data, please replace `pliot_data.csv` with your data following the same format, and update proportion correct by DLMO and its variance in the `power_analysis_BDG.R`.
