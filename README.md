# Evaluating the resolution of AI-based accelerated MR reconstruction using a deep learning-based model observer (DLMO)
**The DLMO framework** evaluates multi-coil sensitivity encoding parallel MR imaging systems at different acceleration factors on the Rayleigh discrimination task as a surrogate measure of resolution, as detailed in our paper. You can implement the DLMO framework with other vendor-specific image acquisition settings and reconstruction methods to demonstrate their diagnostic efficacy.
