# Pivotal study

This script conducts a similarity test to investigate whether DLMO performs similarly to human readers within a pre-defined margin of 0.1 proportion correct. To run the script, simply execute `similarity_test.R`. To use it for your own project, please update the `DLMO reading results` section in `similarity_test.R`, and provide reading scores in the `reading_scores` folder following the same format.
